# Optimized JMeter Docker Image

This Dockerfile demonstrates a two-stage multi-layer build that reduces the image size of Apache JMeter by ~45% using a builder pattern.

## Problem Statement

Standard Docker images for JMeter are often bulky (600MB+), including unnecessary build tools and dependencies. This makes them inefficient for CI/CD pipelines, cloud usage, and edge environments.

## Our Approach

- Use a **builder stage** to download and extract JMeter
- Use a **minimal JRE base** (no JDK) for the final image
- Copy only the JMeter binaries needed for runtime

## Before vs After

| Metric         | Before (Single-stage) | After (Optimized) |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Image Size     | 620MB                 | 340MB             |
| Base Image     | JDK                   | JRE only          |
| Download Time  | ~40s                  | ~20s              |
| Startup Speed  | Slower                | Faster            |

## Build Locally

```bash
docker build -t jmeter-optimized .
docker run --rm jmeter-optimized -v
```
